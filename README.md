# PacManExercise_KiranMajid

// Description

PacMan exercises that was completed during my MITxPRO bootcamp.
During this project I was tasked with creating a PacMan character in html that would utilize JavaScript to make the character move back and forth, before animating them using an array of images & lastly checking the borders of the viewport as to allow PacMan to change directions as it approached the end. 

I took this a step further by beginning to create a full fledge PacMan game underneath this initial work that would allow the users to play the game itself.

// How To Run
This script can be tested by downloading the .zip including the index, css, and js files. Once downloaded and unzipped, you may open the html file to test. As you click on the screen you can watch PacMan utilize the JavaScript code as it's motion changes. 

// Road Map of Improvements

In the future, I plan to work further to allow this PacMan code to animate the character in the grid itself, this is the next biggest step I have, although I have been struggling to set up the functions correctly within my switch statements. Overall this will be a simple fix that will elevate the game play a lot.
